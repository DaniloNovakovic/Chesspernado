- @2KNIGHT@: The knight moves in 'L' shape (marked fields on picture above). 
~
- @2BISHOP@: can move any number of squares diagonally,but cannot leap over pieces. 
~
- @1AI_PAWN@ (@3p@): The pawn can move forward to the unoccupied 
square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move 
it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are 
unoccupied; or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square 
diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square. 
The AI_PAWN will prioritize eating enemy piece over going forward. 
(@1AI_PAWN@ is worth@6 6 @points)

- @1AI_BISHOP@ (@6b@): -rules of regular bishop but will only move in 
following manner. BISHOP AI always @3"wakes up on the left foot"@ 
meaning that he will prioritize moving as far to the bottom-left 
as he can above all. Only if he is unable to move to the left anymore 
will he swap directions.
@3AI_BISHOP will only eat enemy piece if it is caught in this LEFT-RIGHT 
pattern!@  
(@1AI_BISHOP@ is worth@6 12 @points)

SPECIAL PIECES:
- @2SUICIDE ROOK@ (@7R@): Is a special piece that lasts for @7ONE MOVE ONLY.@ 
He first waits for player /other pieces to make a move, and then
sprints forward [i+k][j] until he hits ANYTHING 
(either end of the board, enemy or the player). 
@1Once he collides with an object he will then explode, killing both 
himself and that object (either player or enemy).@ 
User can buy this piece in the shop as many times as he likes as 
long as he has points for it, and he can place as many as the suicide 
rooks he likes. If there are multiply suicide rooks on the board the 
priority will have those in front.
 
- @2HAPPY KING@ (@7K@): Is a special piece that lasts until destroyed. 
@3Happy King is so happy that he won't hurth a fly, meaning that
