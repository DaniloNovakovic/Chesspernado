## Update 9/May/2019 (Personal log):

This project is an example of how NOT to write code. It is full of code smells and poorly named variables, with methods that do too many things.

Additionally it is not covered by tests making even refactoring pretty hard.

However, it holds significant historical value to myself since it taught me alot.

At the time of writing this project i was just starting out and this was biggest challange i posed to myself at that time. A new challange today would be to refactor this into more readable code without breaking its functionality.
